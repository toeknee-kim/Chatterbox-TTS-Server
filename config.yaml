  last_text: '[clear throat] Um, hi everyone. [cough] Excuse me. So, when Jessica
    asked me to be her maid of honor, I cried. [laugh] Not graceful tears either,
    like ugly sobbing. [sniff] We''ve been friends for fifteen years, and I cannot
    believe we''re here today. [sigh] Okay, I promised myself I wouldn''t cry during
    this speech, so let''s see how long that lasts. [chuckle] For those who don''t
    know, I met Jessica in college when she accidentally set fire to our dorm microwave.
    [gasp] It was a small fire! Very small! [laugh] And I knew right then that this
    was someone who would keep life interesting. [groan] I was right, by the way.
    Life with Jessica is never boring. [sniff] She once convinced me to do karaoke
    at a biker bar. [cough] I do not want to talk about what we sang. [clear throat]
    But here''s what I do want to say. [sigh] Jessica is the most loyal, the most
    kind, and the most ridiculously stubborn person I know. [chuckle] Marcus, you''re
    getting a good one, but also, good luck. [laugh] She will argue about pineapple
    on pizza until her dying breath. [shush] But she loves with her whole heart, and
    I know she loves you. [sniff] So please raise your glasses. [gasp] Wait, I''m
    not done! [sigh] Sorry, I''m nervous. [clear throat] To Jessica and Marcus: may
    your love be as enduring as Jessica''s grudge against that one restaurant that
    got her order wrong in 2019. [laugh] She still won''t go back. [sniff] Cheers,
    everyone!
